## Get started in three steps

Set up your Utari workspace, configure your first AI agents, and run your first automated task.

### Step 1: Create your workspace

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Sign up and create your account">
    1. Visit [utari.ai](https://utari.ai) in your browser
    2. Click **"Get started"** and sign up using Google, GitHub, or email
    3. Complete email verification if required
    4. Wait while Utari sets up your workspace automatically
    
    <Tip>Your workspace is your private environment where agents, data, and settings live.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="sparkles" title="Complete first-time onboarding">
    Follow the guided setup to personalize your AI workforce:
    
    1. **Choose your usage type**: Individual or company/team
    2. **Select starter agents**: Pick from research, operations, content, or technical agents
    3. **Configure agent settings** (optional):
       - Set names and roles
       - Define primary goals
       - Choose tone and style (formal, concise, friendly)
    4. Click **"Start Working"** to reach your dashboard
    
    <Note>You can refine or add agents anytime—this setup just gets you productive fast.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Run your first task

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message" title="Start a conversation with an agent">
    1. From your dashboard, click **"New Thread"** or open an existing thread
    2. Select your primary agent (e.g., your generalist agent)
    3. Describe your goal clearly:
       - **What you want**: "Summarize this market report into a 1-page executive brief"
       - **Context**: Who it's for, length, tone, deadline
    
    <Tip>Attach files or links using the upload button to give your agent source material.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Let your agent work and iterate">
    Your agent will:
    - Read your files and analyze content
    - Browse or research (if tools are enabled)
    - Generate structured output (summaries, plans, drafts, checklists)
    
    **Refine the output** with follow-ups:
    - "Make this shorter and more executive-friendly"
    - "Turn this into an email for my team"
    - "Highlight the top 3 risks and mitigations"
    
    <Tip>All context stays in the thread—agents remember everything!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Customize your AI workforce

<Accordion icon="users-gear" title="Refine and expand your team">
  **Edit existing agents:**
  1. Go to **Agents / Workforce** section
  2. Open an agent and update:
     - Description and expertise areas
     - Preferred output formats
     - Tone and communication style
  
  **Create specialized agents** for recurring workflows:
  - **Research Analyst**: Market and competitor research
  - **Operations Coordinator**: SOPs, process docs, checklists
  - **Client Delivery Assistant**: Client-ready deliverables
  
  <Tip>When an agent produces great output, save it as an example to guide future work.</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Core concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Workspace" icon="building">
    Your private environment where agents, data, and settings live. Invite teammates when team features are enabled.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="AI Agents" icon="robot">
    Specialized AI workers configured with goals, tone, and tool access to handle specific workflows.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Threads" icon="comments">
    Persistent conversations that keep history, context, and files so agents can pick up where they left off.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Tools" icon="wrench">
    External capabilities like web browsing, data APIs, and sandboxes that let agents act, not just chat.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Research & synthesis">
    **Example**: "Research the top 5 vendors for X, summarize their offerings, pricing ranges, and pros/cons in a table."
    
    Agents can browse the web, pull data, and create comprehensive comparison reports.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Operations & processes">
    **Example**: "Take these meeting notes and turn them into an action plan with owners and deadlines."
    
    Transform raw notes into structured workflows, SOPs, and trackable deliverables.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-contract" title="Client deliverables">
    **Example**: "Convert this technical analysis into a client-ready summary in simple language."
    
    Repackage internal work into polished, stakeholder-appropriate documents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="calendar-days" title="Personal productivity">
    **Example**: "Help me plan my week based on these tasks; prioritize and group them, then create a schedule."
    
    Let agents handle planning, prioritization, and time management.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced features

### Connect tools and data

Unlock powerful capabilities by connecting external tools:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable web & data tools">
    Allow agents to research the web, pull public data, and enrich information with search and crawling capabilities.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add execution tools">
    Enable code execution and sandboxes for data analysis, transformations, and automation tasks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Integrate external systems">
    Connect your existing tools so agents can read/write data, sync projects, and trigger automations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Start with **view-only / low-risk access**, validate agent behavior, then gradually expand permissions.</Warning>

## Next steps

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Run real tasks" icon="rocket">
    Complete 3–5 real tasks with your primary agent (research, planning, writing).
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Create specialized agents" icon="user-plus">
    Build one agent for a recurring workflow you care about.
