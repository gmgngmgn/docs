## Overview

Integrations allow you to connect your Utari workers to external applications and services, dramatically expanding what they can do. By adding integrations, your workers can interact with Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, Google Sheets, and many other apps to create powerful automation workflows.

## Types of Integrations

Utari supports two types of integrations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Standard Applications" icon="grid">
    Pre-built integrations with popular apps like Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, and more—ready to connect with just a few clicks
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Servers" icon="server">
    Custom Model Context Protocol servers that you can build and host to connect specialized tools or proprietary systems
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **MCP Server Note**: Utari does not host MCP servers. If you're using custom MCP servers, ensure they are hosted and accessible before connecting them to your workers.
</Info>

## Adding an Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Worker">
    Log into your Utari account at [https://utari.ai/dashboard](https://utari.ai/dashboard), go to **Workers**, and select the worker you want to enhance with integrations.
    
    For example, select "Facebook Ads Generator" or any other worker.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Integrations Tab">
    Click on the **Integrations** tab in the worker's configuration panel. This is where you manage all connected apps for this worker.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse Available Apps">
    Click **Browse Apps** to see the full catalog of available integrations, including:
    - Gmail
    - Google Calendar
    - Slack
    - Google Sheets
    - Google Drive
    - Asana
    - Trello
    - And many more
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search and Select">
    Search for the application you want to connect, or browse through categories. Once you find it, click **Add** next to the app name.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting an Integration

Let's use Slack as an example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Connection">
    After clicking **Add**, you'll see a prompt to create a new connection.
    
    Click **Create new connection**, then click **Create connection**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Click **Connect** to launch the authentication popup. This will open the app's authorization page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Account">
    In the popup, select the specific account you want to connect to this worker.
    
    **Important**: Make sure you select the correct account, especially if you have multiple accounts for the same service.
    
    For example, select "Best of AI" workspace if that's the Slack workspace for this worker.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    Review the permissions requested and click **Install** or **Allow** to grant access.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Authentication">
    Once the popup closes, click **I've completed authentication** to finalize the connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Always verify you're connecting the correct account. Connecting the wrong account could cause the worker to access the wrong data or perform actions in the wrong workspace.
</Warning>

## Configuring Integration Tools

After connecting an integration, you need to select which specific capabilities (tools) your worker can use:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Available Tools">
    You'll see a list of all available tools for that integration. For example, Slack might offer:
    - Add reaction to message
    - Create reminder
    - Send message to channel
    - Post direct message
    - Upload file
    - List channels
    - And more
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Required Tools">
    Check the boxes next to the tools you want to enable for this worker. Only enable tools that are relevant to the worker's purpose.
    
    For example, if your worker only needs to send messages, enable just the messaging tools.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click **Save tools** to apply your selections. You'll see a confirmation showing how many tools are now enabled (e.g., "6 tools enabled").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify Settings (Optional)">
    Click the **settings icon** (gear icon) next to the integration to adjust tool permissions or connection settings at any time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Start with the essential tools your worker needs, then add more capabilities as your requirements evolve. Too many tools can overwhelm the worker's decision-making.
</Tip>

## Custom MCP Servers

For advanced users who need custom integrations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Develop Your MCP Server">
    Build a Model Context Protocol server following the MCP specification for your custom tools or APIs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Host the Server">
    Deploy and host your MCP server on your own infrastructure. Ensure it's accessible and secure.
    
    **Note**: Utari does not provide MCP server hosting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add to Utari">
    In the Integrations tab, you can add your custom MCP server by providing its endpoint URL and authentication details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Tools">
    Select which tools from your custom server should be available to the worker.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Custom MCP servers allow you to integrate proprietary systems, internal databases, or specialized tools that aren't available in the standard integration catalog.
</Info>

## Integration Security

<Warning>
  **Security Best Practices:**
  - Only connect integrations from trusted sources
  - Review permissions carefully before granting access
  - Use the principle of least privilege—only enable necessary tools
  - Regularly audit connected accounts
  - Revoke access for unused integrations
  - Use separate accounts for testing vs. production
  - Follow your organization's security policies
</Warning>
