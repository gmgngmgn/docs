description: "Learn how to automate your Utari workers with scheduled and event-based triggers to streamline workflows and execute tasks automatically without manual intervention."
---

## Overview

Triggers enable you to automate your Utari workers by scheduling them to run at specific times or in response to events. This powerful automation capability allows your workers to perform tasks daily, hourly, or on custom schedules—completely hands-free. Whether you need daily reports, regular monitoring, or event-driven responses, triggers make it possible.

## Types of Triggers

Utari supports two types of triggers for different automation needs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Schedule Trigger" icon="clock">
    Execute workers on a time-based schedule—daily, hourly, weekly, or custom intervals
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event-Based Trigger" icon="bolt">
    Activate workers automatically when specific events occur in connected apps
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  This guide focuses on schedule triggers. Event-based triggers documentation is coming soon.
</Info>

## Where to Create Triggers

You can create triggers from two locations in Utari:

### Option 1: Within the Worker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Worker">
    Navigate to the worker you want to automate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Triggers Section">
    Click on the **Triggers** tab within the worker's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Trigger">
    Click **Create new** to start configuring a trigger for this specific worker.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: From Triggers Tab

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Triggers">
    Go to the main **Triggers** tab in your Utari dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Trigger">
    Click **Add new trigger** to create a trigger.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Worker">
    Choose which worker this trigger should activate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Both methods achieve the same result. Use the worker-specific method when configuring a single worker, or the main Triggers tab when managing multiple trigger workflows.
</Tip>

## Creating a Schedule Trigger

Let's create a schedule trigger step by step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Trigger Type">
    Choose **Schedule Trigger** from the available trigger types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Agent/Worker">
    Choose the worker that will be activated by this trigger. Make sure the worker has all necessary tools and integrations configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Trigger">
    Provide a clear, descriptive name for the trigger (e.g., "Daily AI News Research" or "Weekly Report Generation").

    Optionally, add a description to document the trigger's purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Schedule">
    Click **Set schedule and timing** to choose when the trigger runs. You have several options:

    **Quick Options:**

    - Every minute
    - Every 5 minutes
    - Every 15 minutes
    - Every 30 minutes
    - Every hour
    - Daily at 9 AM (default)

    **Recurring Schedules:**

    - Daily (choose specific time)
    - Weekly (choose day and time)
    - Monthly (choose date and time)

    **One-Time:**

    - Execute once at a specific date and time

    **Advanced:**

    - Custom cron expressions for complex schedules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Time Zone">
    **Critical Step**: Adjust the time zone to match your preferred location. The trigger will execute based on the selected time zone.

    For example, if you set "Daily at 9 AM" with Mountain Time, it will run at 9 AM Mountain Time every day.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Execution Method">
    Click **Choose execution method** to proceed to defining what the worker will do.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Instructions">
    Write clear, specific instructions for what the agent should do when triggered. This is the prompt the worker will execute.

    **Example:**

    ```
        Use the browser tool to research the top 10 AI news stories from today, then create a summary document and save it in the "Daily News Briefs" folder.
    ```

    Be as specific as possible about:

    - What tools to use
    - What information to gather
    - What output to create
    - Where to save results
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Schedule Task">
    Click **Create schedule task** to activate your trigger.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule Configuration Options

### Quick Schedules

Pre-configured intervals for common use cases:

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Recurring Schedules

<CodeGroup>

```text Daily
Run every day at a specific time
Example: Every day at 6:00 PM
```


```text Weekly
Run on specific days of the week
Example: Every Monday and Friday at 10:00 AM
```


```text Monthly
Run on specific dates each month
Example: 1st and 15th of every month at 2:00 PM
```

</CodeGroup>

### Advanced Scheduling

For complex schedules, use cron expressions:

```text
0 9 * * 1-5    # Every weekday at 9 AM
0 */4 * * *    # Every 4 hours
0 0 1 * *      # First day of every month at midnight
30 14 * * 0    # Every Sunday at 2:30 PM
```

<Note>
  Cron expressions give you precise control over scheduling but require understanding cron syntax. Use online cron generators if needed.
</Note>

## Writing Effective Trigger Instructions

The instructions you provide determine what your worker does when triggered. Follow these best practices:

### Be Specific and Clear

❌ **Vague Instructions:**

```text
Research AI news
```

✅ **Specific Instructions:**

```text
Use the web search tool to find the top 10 AI news stories published today. For each story, extract the headline, source, and a brief summary. Create a document with all findings and save it in "Daily Briefings/AI News/[DATE]" folder.
```

### Include All Necessary Steps

```text
1. Search for "AI industry news today" using web search
2. Visit the top 5 results and capture screenshots
3. Extract key points from each article
4. Compile findings into a formatted report
5. Save the report as "AI News Digest - [DATE].docx" in the Reports folder
6. Send a Slack message to #team-updates with a summary
```

### Specify Tools and Resources

```text
Using the browser tool and image vision tool, visit competitor websites [URL1, URL2, URL3], take screenshots of their homepages, analyze design changes since last week, and create a comparison document.
```

### Define Output Requirements

```text
Create a spreadsheet with columns: Date, Source, Headline, Category, Sentiment. Populate with today's findings and save to Google Sheets "News Tracker" document.
```

## Advanced Trigger Strategies

### Chained Workflows

Create multiple triggers that work together:

```text
Trigger 1 (Daily 6 AM): Collect data from multiple sources
Trigger 2 (Daily 7 AM): Process and analyze collected data  
Trigger 3 (Daily 8 AM): Generate and distribute reports
```

### Conditional Execution

Include conditional logic in instructions:

```text
Check if today is the first Monday of the month. If yes, generate the monthly executive report. If no, generate the standard daily brief.
```

### Multi-Step Automation

```text
1. Morning (7 AM): Gather overnight data
2. Midday (12 PM): Create progress update
3. Afternoon (4 PM): Prepare end-of-day summary
4. Evening (6 PM): Send comprehensive daily report
```
