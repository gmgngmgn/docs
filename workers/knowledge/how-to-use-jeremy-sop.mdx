## Accessing the Knowledge Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Base">
    Log into your Utari account and click on [**Knowledge Base**](https://www.utari.ai/knowledge) in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Jeremy SOPs">
    You'll see the Jeremy SOPs folder, which contains 27 different SOP files. This area also allows you to add additional knowledge resources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Custom Knowledge (Optional)">
    To add your own resources:

    - Click **Add Knowledge**
    - Select the destination folder
    - Upload your SOPs, PDFs, or other documents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Activating SOPs for Your Agents

Once your SOPs are in the knowledge base, you need to activate them for specific agents to use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Agent">
    Navigate to any worker or agent you've created in your Utari workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Knowledge Settings">
    Click on the **Knowledge** tab within the agent's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Jeremy SOPs">
    You'll see that Jeremy SOPs are available in this agent's workflow by default across all agents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Specific SOPs">
    To give your agent access to a particular SOP:

    - Click the dropdown menu under **Jeremy SOPs**
    - Select the specific SOP you want to activate (e.g., "Mastering VSLs")
    - The agent can now access and reference this SOP during tasks
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You can activate multiple SOPs for a single agent. Only activated SOPs will be accessible to the agent during conversations.
</Note>

## Using SOPs in Conversations

Once you've activated an SOP, your agent can reference it during chat interactions.

### Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Chat">
    Open a conversation with your agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request SOP Information">
    Ask the agent to reference the activated SOP. For example:

    ```
    Can you describe the rundown for mastering VSLs in your knowledge base?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Model (Optional)">
    Choose your preferred AI model (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5) for optimal performance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Response">
    The agent will:

    - Search for the relevant document in the knowledge base
    - Verify access to the document
    - Analyze the content
    - Provide a comprehensive summary
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Usage

After the agent has accessed the SOP, you can give it additional instructions based on that knowledge:

```
Based on the knowledge in your knowledge base, write me a VSL on [your topic]
```

The agent will use the SOP guidelines to create content that follows the established procedures and best practices.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent can't find the SOP">
    Verify that:

    - The SOP is uploaded to the knowledge base
    - The SOP is activated in the agent's Knowledge settings
    - You're referencing the correct SOP name in your query
