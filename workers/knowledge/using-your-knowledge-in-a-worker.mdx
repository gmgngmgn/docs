description: "Learn how to upload documents, SOPs, and reference materials to your Utari knowledge base to make them available for your workers."
---

## Overview

The knowledge base in Utari is your central repository for documents, SOPs, frameworks, and reference materials. By uploading knowledge to your workspace, you make it available for workers to reference, ensuring they have access to your specific guidelines, processes, and information when performing tasks.

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Files Ready" icon="file">
    Documents prepared and saved in supported formats
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace Access" icon="key">
    Proper permissions to add knowledge to your workspace
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Size Check" icon="scale-balanced">
    Files under the 50MB total limit
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Accessing Your Knowledge Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Profile Menu">
    Click on your **profile icon** in the top navigation of your Utari workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Base">
    Select **Knowledge Base** from the dropdown menu.

    This opens your workspace's central knowledge repository where all uploaded documents are stored.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Your knowledge base is workspace-wide, meaning all uploaded knowledge is available to any worker you configure—you just need to activate it for specific workers.
</Info>

## Adding Knowledge to Your Knowledge Base

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Upload Process">
    Click the **Add Knowledge** button to begin adding new content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or Create Folder">
    Choose where to organize your knowledge:

    **Option A: Select Existing Folder**

    - Click on an existing folder from the list

    **Option B: Create New Folder**

    - Click the **plus icon (+)** to create a new folder
    - Enter a descriptive folder name (e.g., "Marketing SOPs" or "Testing")
    - The new folder is immediately created and ready to use
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Upload Method">
    Select how you want to add knowledge:

    - **Upload Files**: Add documents from your computer
    - **Text Entry**: Paste or type content directly
    - **Git Clone**: Import from repositories (coming soon)

    For this guide, we'll focus on **Upload Files**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Files to Upload">
    Click the **file input area** or drag and drop files to upload.

    Browse your computer and select the file(s) you want to add to your knowledge base.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Upload">
    Ensure your files are within the size limit before completing the upload.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Upload">
    Once files are selected and validated, complete the upload process.

    Your knowledge is now available in the knowledge base and can be activated for workers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## File Size Limits

<Warning>
  **Important Limitation**: The current file size limit is **50MB total** for your knowledge base.

  If you exceed this limit when uploading, you'll see the error: **"File size limit exceeded"**
</Warning>

### Managing Storage Limits

If you encounter the file size limit:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Current Files">
    Check your existing knowledge base files to identify:

    - Large files that could be compressed
    - Outdated files that can be deleted
    - Duplicate files taking up space
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete Unnecessary Files">
    Remove files that are:

    - No longer relevant or current
    - Duplicates of other documents
    - Replaced by newer versions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Files">
    Before uploading, consider:

    - Compressing PDF files
    - Reducing image quality in documents
    - Splitting large documents into smaller sections
    - Converting to more efficient file formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry Upload">
    After freeing up space, attempt your upload again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Regularly audit your knowledge base to remove outdated content and maintain available storage space.
</Tip>

## Supported File Types

## Organizing Your Knowledge Base

### Folder Structure Best Practices

Create a logical hierarchy that makes knowledge easy to find and activate:

  <Step title="Navigate to Worker">
    Go to the worker that should use this knowledge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Knowledge Tab">
    Click on the **Knowledge** tab in the worker's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Knowledge">
    Check the boxes next to knowledge resources this worker should access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Knowledge Tool">
    Ensure the **Knowledge Base** tool is enabled in the Tools tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  For detailed instructions on activating knowledge for workers, see our [Activate and Assign Knowledge](/activate-knowledge) guide.

## Managing Your Knowledge Base

### Updating Knowledge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload New Version">
