description: "Learn how to provide your Utari workers with access to custom knowledge bases, SOPs, and documents to enhance their performance with your specific frameworks and information."

## Overview

Knowledge in Utari allows you to give your workers access to your own documents, SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), frameworks, and reference materials. By activating knowledge for a worker, you enable it to reference your specific guidelines, methodologies, and information when performing tasks—ensuring outputs align with your standards and processes.

</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before assigning knowledge to a worker, ensure:

1. **Knowledge is uploaded** to your Utari knowledge base
2. **Knowledge base tool is enabled** for the worker
3. **Worker is properly configured** with necessary tools and capabilities

## Activating Knowledge for Workers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Worker">
    Navigate to the worker you want to enhance with knowledge (e.g., "Facebook Ads Generator").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Knowledge Tab">
    Click on the **Knowledge** tab in the worker's configuration panel.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse Available Knowledge">
    You'll see all folders and resources available in your knowledge base:
    - Organized folders
    - Individual SOPs
    - PDF documents
    - Other uploaded resources
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Knowledge Resources">
    Click the **checkbox** next to each knowledge resource you want to activate for this worker.
    
    The worker will have access to all checked resources during conversations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Tool Activation">
    **Critical Step**: Navigate to the **Tools** tab and ensure the **Knowledge Base** tool is enabled.
    
    Click the checkbox next to "Knowledge Base" if it's not already activated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: If the Knowledge Base tool is not enabled in the Tools tab, the worker will fail when trying to access knowledge, even if specific resources are activated in the Knowledge tab.
</Warning>

## Understanding Context Limits

When activating knowledge for workers, be aware of context limits:

<Note>
  **Context Window Consideration**: The more knowledge you activate for a worker, the more of its context window is consumed by reference material. This may reduce the space available for:
  - Your prompts and instructions
  - Conversation history
  - Generated responses
  - Tool outputs
</Note>

### Finding the Right Balance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Focused Knowledge" icon="bullseye">
    **Best Practice**: Activate only knowledge directly relevant to the worker's specific purpose
    
    **Benefits**:
    - More space for conversation
    - Faster response times
    - More focused outputs
    - Reduced confusion
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Comprehensive Knowledge" icon="books">
    **Use When**: Worker handles diverse tasks requiring multiple frameworks
    
    **Trade-offs**:
    - Less space for prompts
    - Potentially slower responses
    - May need to reference specific docs explicitly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Knowledge Activation Strategies

## Using Activated Knowledge

Once knowledge is activated, workers can reference it automatically or when prompted:

### Automatic Reference

Workers intelligently reference activated knowledge when relevant:
```text
User: Write an ad for our new product

Worker: [References brand voice guidelines and ad copy framework]
[Creates ad following activated SOPs]
```

### Explicit Reference

You can explicitly request knowledge use:

<CodeGroup>
```text Reference Specific SOP
Using the Facebook Ads SOP in your knowledge base, create a campaign for our new product launch.
```
```text Follow Framework
Apply the content creation framework from your knowledge to write a blog post about AI trends.
```
```text Check Against Guidelines
Review this ad copy against our brand guidelines and suggest improvements.
```
```text Use Multiple Resources
Combine insights from the marketing SOP and audience research document to create a strategy.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing Knowledge Resources

    - Being more explicit in prompts: "Use the [specific SOP] to..."
    - Checking if multiple conflicting knowledge sources are active
    - Ensuring the knowledge document is clear and well-structured
    - Testing with simpler, more direct references
    - Reducing other activated knowledge to minimize confusion
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Context limit errors or truncated responses">
    Reduce context usage by:

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Knowledge Strategies

### Layered Knowledge

Combine different types of knowledge for comprehensive guidance:
```text
Base Layer: General brand guidelines (all workers)
Role Layer: Department-specific SOPs (role-specific workers)

```

### Dynamic Knowledge Selection

Create multiple versions of workers with different knowledge sets:
```text
Blog Writer (Beginner): Basic writing guidelines only
Blog Writer (Advanced): Full SEO SOP + style guide + examples
Blog Writer (Technical): Technical writing standards + product docs
```

### Knowledge + Triggers

Combine activated knowledge with scheduled triggers:
```text
Daily Report Worker:
- Activated: Reporting template + data sources guide
- Trigger: Daily at 8 AM
- Result: Consistent daily reports following template
```
