description: "Create local git commits in the sandbox workspace to track changes, maintain version history, and manage code iterations without remote repositories."

## Overview

The Local Git Commit tool enables your Utari workers to create git commits directly in the sandbox workspace at `/workspace`. This capability provides version control for your work, tracking changes over time and maintaining a history of iterations—all locally without requiring remote repositories or origins.

## Local Git Commit Capability

<Card title="Version Control in Workspace" icon="code-branch">
  Create git commits to:

  - Track changes to files and code
  - Maintain version history
  - Document work progress
  - Enable rollback to previous states
  - Organize development iterations
  - Keep audit trail of modifications

  **Important**: All commits are local only—no remote repositories, pushing, or pulling.
</Card>

<Info>
  Local git commits work entirely within the `/workspace` directory. No connection to GitHub, GitLab, or other remote services is required or used.
</Info>

## Using Local Git Commit

### Basic Commit Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Work on files in the workspace:

    ```
        - Create new files
        - Modify existing code
        - Update documentation
        - Develop features
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Commit">
    Ask your worker to create a git commit:

    ```
        Create a git commit with the message "Add user authentication feature"
        
        Commit these changes with message "Fix bug in data processing"
        
        Make a git commit: "Update documentation for API endpoints"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Worker Creates Commit">
    ```
        Creating local git commit...
        
        Changes staged:
        - src/auth.py (modified)
        - src/user.py (new file)
        - tests/test_auth.py (new file)
        
        Commit created: abc123f
        Message: "Add user authentication feature"
        Author: Utari Worker
        Date: 2024-12-24 14:30:22
        
        3 files changed, 247 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue Working">
    Your changes are now committed locally. Continue development and create more commits as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    Track documentation changes:

    ```
        "Add API authentication section to docs"
        "Update installation instructions for v2.0"
        "Add troubleshooting guide for common errors"

    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Commit Message Best Practices

### Writing Effective Commit Messages

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Examples">
    ```text
        ✅ "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
        ✅ "Fix null pointer exception in data parser"
        ✅ "Update README with installation instructions"
        ✅ "Refactor database connection handling"
        ✅ "Remove deprecated API endpoints"
        ✅ "Optimize image loading performance"
    ```

    **Why these work**:

    - Clear, specific action
    - Describes what changed
    - Concise but informative
    - Starts with imperative verb
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Poor Examples">
    ```text
        ❌ "Updates"
        ❌ "Fixed stuff"
        ❌ "More changes"
        ❌ "WIP"
        ❌ "asdf"
        ❌ "Changed some files"
    ```

    **Why these fail**:

    - Too vague
    - No context
    - Unhelpful for history
    - Doesn't describe what changed
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Commit Message Format

<Card title="Recommended Format">
  ```
    <type>: <short description>
    
    Examples:
    feat: Add dark mode toggle to settings
    fix: Resolve memory leak in worker threads
    docs: Update API reference documentation
    refactor: Simplify error handling logic
    test: Add unit tests for auth module
    chore: Update dependencies to latest versions
  ```

  **Common types**:

  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring
  - `test`: Adding/updating tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
  - `perf`: Performance improvements

```bash View Recent Commits
git log --oneline -10

# Shows last 10 commits with short hashes and messages
```


```bash View Detailed History
git log -5

# Shows last 5 commits with full details
```


```bash View Changes in Commit
git show abc123f

# Shows what changed in specific commit
```


```bash View File History
git log -- src/auth.py

# Shows commits that modified specific file
```


```bash Search Commits
git log --grep="authentication"

# Find commits with "authentication" in message
```

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Local Only**:

  - No remote repositories
  - No pushing to GitHub/GitLab
  - No pulling from remotes
  - No collaboration via git
  - Commits exist only in `/workspace`

  This tool is for local version control and tracking, not for sharing code via git remotes.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commit fails with error">
    Check:

    - Git is initialized in workspace (`git init` if needed)
    - Files actually have changes to commit
    - Commit message is provided
    - No merge conflicts present
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't see commit history">
    Verify:

    - You're in correct directory
    - Git repository exists
    - Commits have actually been created
    - Use `git log` to view history
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not included in commit">
    Ensure:

    - Files are in `/workspace` directory
    - Changes were saved before committing
    - Files aren't in .gitignore
    - Git is tracking the files
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
