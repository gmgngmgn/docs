## Overview

The Agent Configuration tool enables your Utari workers to modify and customize other agents dynamically. This meta-capability allows workers to adapt agent configurations, enable or disable tools, adjust instructions, and connect integrations—all through natural conversation. It's particularly powerful for creating specialized agents on-the-fly or adapting existing agents to new requirements.

## Configuration Capabilities Explained

### Get Current Agent Config

Review an agent's existing configuration before making changes:

**What You Can See**:

- Agent name and description
- Currently enabled tools
- Connected MCP servers
- System prompt additions
- Other configuration settings

**When to Use**:

- Before updating an agent to see current state
- To verify what's already configured
- When troubleshooting agent behavior
- To document existing configurations
- Before duplicating or templating agents

**Example Usage**:

```text
Show me the current configuration for my Content Writer agent
What tools are enabled for the Research Assistant?
Check the settings for my Sales Agent
```

### Update Agent

Modify any aspect of an agent's configuration:

**What You Can Update**:

- **Name**: Change the agent's display name
- **Tools**: Enable or disable specific capabilities
- **MCP Servers**: Add or remove integration connections
- **System Prompt Additions**: Add high-priority behavioral instructions

**How Updates Work**:

- Changes apply immediately to the agent
- System prompt additions are appended to existing instructions
- New instructions receive high priority markers
- Existing configuration is preserved unless explicitly changed

<Warning>
  **System Prompt Additions**: When you add instructions to the system prompt, they are appended to the agent's existing instructions with high-priority markers. They don't replace existing instructions but add additional guidance.
</Warning>

## Advanced Configuration Techniques

### Conditional Behavior Instructions

<CodeGroup>

```text Context-Aware Responses
Add instruction:
"When user indicates urgency, prioritize speed over comprehensiveness. When user has time, provide detailed analysis with multiple options."
```


```text Role-Based Behavior
Add instruction:
"Adjust technical depth based on user expertise: beginner (explain all terms), intermediate (assume basic knowledge), expert (use technical language freely)."
```


```text Output Format Adaptation
Add instruction:
"For quick questions, provide concise answers. For research requests, create structured documents with sections, citations, and visualizations."
```

</CodeGroup>

### Multi-Stage Workflows

Configure agents for complex, multi-step processes:

```text
Update my Research Agent with this workflow instruction:

"For comprehensive research tasks:
1. First, conduct broad web search to understand topic landscape
2. Then, use Data Providers for specific data points
3. Cross-reference findings across multiple sources
4. Organize findings in spreadsheet with source tracking
5. Create executive summary document with key insights
6. Flag any conflicting information for manual review"
```

### Quality Control Instructions

<CodeGroup>

```text Accuracy Standards
Add instruction:
"Before presenting financial data, verify from at least two independent sources. Flag any discrepancies for user review."
```


```text Compliance Requirements
Add instruction:
"All medical information must include disclaimer: 'This is for informational purposes only and not medical advice. Consult healthcare professionals for medical decisions.'"
```


```text Brand Consistency
Add instruction:
"All content must align with brand voice guidelines: professional but approachable, data-driven, optimistic about technology, inclusive language."
```

</CodeGroup>

## Combining with Other Tools

Agent Configuration becomes more powerful when combined with other capabilities:

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Configuration update doesn't seem to apply">
    Try:

    - Get current config to verify changes were saved
    - Start a new conversation with the agent
    - Clear any cached sessions
    - Re-apply the update explicitly

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent behavior unchanged after adding instructions">
    Check:

    - Instructions are clear and specific enough
    - No conflicting existing instructions
    - Instructions don't contradict core agent capabilities
    - Try rephrasing instructions more explicitly
    - Use "always" or "never" for clarity
