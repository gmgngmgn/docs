## Overview

The web browser tool gives your Utari workers the ability to actively browse and interact with websites. Unlike web search which finds information, the browser tool allows workers to visit specific URLs, navigate through pages, capture screenshots, and extract content—essentially giving your worker a functional web browser.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Browser tool not activating">
    Verify that:
    - Web browser tool is enabled in worker configuration
    - All necessary capabilities are checked
    - You're providing valid, complete URLs
    - You've dismissed any preview warnings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Screenshots are blank or incomplete">
    Try:
    - Waiting a few seconds for the page to fully load
    - Asking the worker to "wait for the page to load, then take a screenshot"
    - Checking if the website blocks automated access
    - Verifying the URL is correct and publicly accessible
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't access certain websites">
    Check if:
    - The website requires login credentials
    - The site blocks automated browser access
    - The URL is behind a firewall or VPN
    - The website has geo-restrictions
    - Try a different page on the same domain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Preview warning keeps appearing">
    Remember to:
    - Click "I understand" each time it appears
    - This is a security feature to confirm you want the worker to access external websites
    - The warning protects you from unintended navigation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Extracted content is incomplete">
    Improve extraction by:
    - Being more specific about what content to extract
    - Specifying the section or element you need
    - Asking for specific data types (headings, prices, lists, etc.)
    - Trying multiple extraction commands for complex pages
