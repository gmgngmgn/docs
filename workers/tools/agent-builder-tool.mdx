## Overview

The Agent Builder enables your Utari workers to create entirely new AI agents from scratch through conversation. This meta-capability allows workers to design, configure, and deploy specialized agents with custom instructions, integrated services, scheduled automation, and tailored tool sets—all without manual configuration interfaces.

<Warning>
  **User Permission Required**: Agent Builder MUST ask for explicit user confirmation before creating any new agent. Workers will provide details about the planned agent and wait for your approval before proceeding.

## Creating a New Agent

### Agent Creation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Requirements">
    Describe what you need the agent to do:

    ```
        I need an agent that monitors competitor websites daily and generates reports
        
        Create an agent for automating social media content distribution
        
        Build me a research agent that tracks AI industry news
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Worker Proposes Agent">
    Your worker analyzes requirements and proposes an agent configuration:

    ```
        I'll create a "Competitor Intelligence Agent" with:
        
        Name: Competitor Monitor
        Purpose: Daily competitive intelligence tracking and reporting
        
        System Prompt:
        - Monitor competitor websites for changes
        - Track pricing, features, and announcements
        - Generate daily comparison reports
        - Flag significant changes for review
        
        Tools to Enable:

        Integrations:

        - Google Sheets (for data logging)
        
        Scheduled Trigger:
        - Daily at 8 AM
        - Prompt: "Check competitor sites and generate daily report"
        
        Shall I create this agent?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Creation">
    Review and approve the proposed agent:

    ```
        Yes, create this agent
        
        or
        
        Create it, but change the schedule to 9 AM and add Twitter monitoring
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Worker Creates Agent">
    After confirmation, the worker:

    - Creates the new agent
    - Configures all specified tools
    - Sets up system prompts
    - Returns agent details and next steps
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    ```
        Agent created successfully! ✓
        
        Agent Name: Competitor Monitor
        Agent ID: agent-comp-123
        
        Next steps:
        1. Authenticate integrations (Slack, Google Sheets)
        2. Test with a manual run
        3. Scheduled trigger will start tomorrow at 8 AM
        
        Would you like to test the agent now?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Confirming Before Creation

<Info>
  **Critical Requirement**: Workers MUST use the 'ask' tool to request explicit user permission before creating agents. The confirmation request includes full details of the proposed agent configuration.

</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Worker won't create agent without confirmation">
    This is expected behavior:

    - Agent Builder REQUIRES explicit user permission
    - Worker will always ask for confirmation first
    - Review the proposed configuration
    - Reply with clear approval or modifications
    - This safety measure prevents accidental agent creation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration authentication fails">
    Try:

    - Opening auth link in different browser
    - Checking popup blockers
    - Verifying account permissions
    - Ensuring correct account selected
    - Requesting new credential profile if link expired
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduled trigger not executing">
    Verify:

    - Trigger is enabled (not disabled)
    - Cron expression is correct
    - Timezone is set appropriately
    - Agent has all required tools
    - Check trigger execution logs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't behave as expected">
    Review:

    - System prompt clarity and specificity
    - Whether all required tools are enabled
    - If integrations are properly authenticated
    - Execution logs for errors
