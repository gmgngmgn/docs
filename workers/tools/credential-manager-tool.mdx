## Overview

The Credentials Manager enables your Utari workers to securely manage authentication for external services and integrations. Through Composio credential profiles, you can connect agents to third-party platforms, manage API keys, handle OAuth flows, and control which services your agents can access—all while maintaining security and separation of credentials.

## What are Credential Profiles?

<Card title="Understanding Credential Profiles" icon="key">
  Credential profiles are secure containers for authentication information that allow your agents to connect to external services. Each profile:
  
  - **Stores authentication** (API keys, OAuth tokens, credentials)
  - **Connects to specific toolkits** (Slack, Google, Salesforce, etc.)
  - **Can be assigned to multiple agents** for shared access
  - **Maintains security** through encrypted storage
  - **Enables selective access** by controlling which agents use which profiles
</Card>

<Info>
  Think of credential profiles as secure keychains: one profile per service, reusable across multiple agents, managed centrally for security.

  <Step title="Initiate Profile Creation">
    Request creation of a credential profile for a specific service:
```
    Create a credential profile for Slack
    Set up authentication for Google Drive
    Add a credential profile for Salesforce
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Worker Creates Profile">
    Your worker:
    - Creates the Composio credential profile
    - Generates an authentication link
    - Returns the link for you to complete connection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Authentication">
    Click the provided authentication link to:
    - Authorize access to the service
    - Grant required permissions
    - Complete OAuth flow or enter API key
    - Confirm connection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
```
    Authentication successful! 
    
    Profile created: slack-profile-123
    Toolkit: Slack
    Status: Connected
    
    You can now use this profile with your agents.
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign to Agents">
    Configure agents to use the new credential profile for accessing the service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Viewing Existing Profiles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Profile List">
    Ask to see all your credential profiles:
```
    Show me all my credential profiles
    List my connected integrations
    What services do I have authentication for?
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Profiles">
    Worker displays all existing profiles:
```
    Your Credential Profiles:

  <Step title="Check Profile Details">
    Get more information about specific profiles:
```
    Show me details for the slack-main profile
    Which agents use the google-workspace profile?
    When was the salesforce-prod profile created?
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuring Profiles for Agents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Profile and Agent">
    Specify which profile to assign to which agent:
```
    Configure the slack-main profile for my Marketing Agent
    Add the google-workspace profile to my Assistant Agent
    Set up the salesforce-prod profile for the Sales Agent
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Tools">
    Choose which tools from the toolkit the agent can access:
```
    For Slack profile, enable:
    - Send message
    - Upload file
    - Get channels
    
    (Don't enable delete message or admin functions)
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Worker Configures">
    Your worker:
    - Links the credential profile to the agent
    - Enables selected tools
    - Verifies connection
    - Confirms configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Connection">
```
    Slack profile configured for Marketing Agent
    
    Enabled tools:
    ✓ Send message
    ✓ Upload file
    ✓ Get channels
    
    Test: Send a test message to #general
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting Credential Profiles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Profile to Remove">
```
    Delete the old-slack-profile
    Remove the salesforce-test credential profile
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Worker checks if profile is in use:
```
    Warning: slack-old is used by Marketing Agent
    
    Removing this profile will:
    - Disconnect Marketing Agent from Slack
    - Remove authentication
    - Cannot be undone
    
    Confirm deletion?
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Worker Removes Profile">
    Upon confirmation:
    - Profile is deleted from Composio
    - Removed from all agent configurations
    - Authentication is revoked
    - Connection is terminated
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Affected Agents">
```
    Profile deleted successfully
    
    Affected agents:
    - Marketing Agent (no longer has Slack access)
    
    Recommendation: Configure a new profile if Slack access is still needed
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Credential Profile Workflows

### Setting Up a New Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Profile">
```
    Create a credential profile for HubSpot
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Authentication">
```
    Click authentication link → Authorize HubSpot → Grant permissions → Return to Utari
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure for Agent">
```
    Add the hubspot-main profile to my Sales Agent
    Enable tools: Get contacts, Create deals, Update opportunities
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Integration">
```
    Test by creating a sample contact in HubSpot
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Workflows">
```
    Now Sales Agent can:
    - Sync contacts from HubSpot
    - Create new deals
    - Update opportunity stages
    - Track sales activities
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Multiple Environments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Environment-Specific Profiles">
```
    Create credential profiles:
    - salesforce-dev (for testing)
    - salesforce-staging (for QA)
    - salesforce-prod (for production)
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign to Different Agents">
```
    - Development Agent: Use salesforce-dev
    - QA Agent: Use salesforce-staging
    - Sales Agent: Use salesforce-prod
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Control Access">
```
    Ensure agents can't accidentally:
    - Test in production
    - Modify production data during development
    - Mix environment data
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Team Collaboration Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Shared Profiles">
```
    Create profiles for team services:
    - slack-team (team communication)
    - google-shared (shared workspace)
    - notion-team (documentation)
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Distribute to Agents">
```
    All agents get:
    - slack-team (for notifications)
    - notion-team (for documentation)
    
    Specific agents get:
    - google-shared (only for agents that need it)
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Maintain Consistency">
```
    Using shared profiles ensures:
    - Consistent access across agents
    - Centralized credential management
    - Easy updates when credentials change
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Types

### OAuth (Most Common)

<Card title="OAuth Flow" icon="shield-check">
  **Process**:
  1. Create credential profile
  2. Click authentication link
  3. Authorize in browser
  4. Grant requested permissions
  5. Automatic token management
  
  **Platforms**: Google, Slack, Salesforce, Microsoft, GitHub, LinkedIn, most SaaS
  
  **Benefits**:
  - Secure, browser-based
  - No passwords stored
  - Automatic token refresh
  - Granular permissions
  
  **Example**:
```
  Create profile for Google Drive
  → Click auth link
  → "Allow Utari to access Google Drive?"
  → Grant permission
  → Connected!
```
</Card>

### API Key Authentication

<Card title="API Key Flow" icon="key">
  **Process**:
  1. Get API key from service
  2. Create credential profile
  3. Enter API key when prompted
  4. Validate connection
  
  **Platforms**: OpenAI, Anthropic, SendGrid, Stripe, custom APIs
  
  **Considerations**:
  - More manual setup
  - Keys must be kept secure
  - No automatic expiration
  - Full account access
  
  **Example**:
```
  Create profile for OpenAI
  → Enter API key: sk-...
  → Validate
  → Connected!
```
</Card>

### Username/Password Authentication

<Card title="Credentials Flow" icon="user-lock">
  **Process**:
  1. Create credential profile
  2. Enter username and password
  3. May require 2FA
  4. Credentials stored securely
  
  **Platforms**: Legacy systems, databases, internal tools
  
  **Considerations**:
  - Less secure than OAuth
  - Manual updates needed
  - May require periodic re-auth
  
  **Example**:
```
  Create profile for internal database
  → Enter username: admin
  → Enter password: [secure]
  → Connected!
```
</Card>

## Credential Profile Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One Profile Per Service" icon="fingerprint">
    Create separate profiles for each service/platform rather than reusing credentials
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Descriptive Naming" icon="tag">
    Use clear, descriptive names: "slack-marketing" instead of "profile-1"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Environment Separation" icon="layer-group">
    Maintain separate profiles for dev, staging, and production environments
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Least Privilege" icon="shield-halved">
    Only grant the minimum permissions necessary for each agent's tasks
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Audits" icon="clipboard-check">
    Periodically review which profiles exist and which agents use them
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Remove Unused" icon="trash">
    Delete profiles that are no longer needed to reduce security surface
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Document Purpose" icon="book">
    Keep notes on why each profile exists and which workflows use it
  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Profile Naming Conventions

### Recommended Patterns

<CodeGroup>
```text By Service + Purpose
slack-marketing
slack-support
google-personal
google-team
salesforce-sales
salesforce-marketing
```
```text By Environment
github-dev
github-staging
github-prod
database-test
database-production
```
```text By Team/Department
notion-engineering
notion-product
hubspot-sales
hubspot-marketing
```
```text By Function
gmail-outreach
gmail-notifications
drive-backups
drive-collaboration
```
</CodeGroup>

### Naming Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Descriptive" icon="comment">
    ✅ `slack-customer-support`
    
    ❌ `slack1`
    
    Clear names help identify purpose at a glance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Context" icon="circle-info">
    ✅ `salesforce-prod-sales-team`
    
    ❌ `sf`
    
    Context prevents confusion when multiple profiles exist
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Consistent Format" icon="align-left">
    ✅ All profiles use format: `service-environment-purpose`
    
    ❌ Mix of formats: `slack_dev`, `prodGoogle`, `salesforce-marketing`
    
    Consistency aids organization and discovery
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid Special Characters" icon="ban">
    ✅ `google-drive-backups`
    
    ❌ `google/drive (backups)!`
    
    Use hyphens or underscores, avoid spaces and symbols
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

### Credential Security

<Warning>
  **Critical Security Practices**:
  
  - Never share authentication links publicly
  - Don't include credentials in prompts or instructions
  - Use separate profiles for different security levels
  - Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
  - Review granted permissions periodically
  - Delete unused profiles immediately
  - Monitor agent access patterns
  - Use OAuth over API keys when possible
</Warning>

### Access Control

<Steps>
  <Step title="Principle of Least Privilege">
```
    Only grant the minimum permissions needed:
    
    ✅ Marketing Agent: Send Slack messages
    ❌ Marketing Agent: Delete channels, manage users
    
    ✅ Research Agent: Read Google Sheets
    ❌ Research Agent: Delete files, manage permissions
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Separate Production and Testing">
```
    Development Agent → test-profile (safe to experiment)
    Production Agent → prod-profile (restricted access)
    
    Never use production credentials in development agents
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Regular Permission Reviews">
```
    Monthly audit:
    - Which profiles exist?
    - Which agents use each profile?
    - Are permissions still appropriate?
    - Any unused profiles to delete?
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Credential Rotation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Rotation Need">
    Rotate credentials when:
    - Regular schedule (quarterly, annually)
    - Team member leaves
    - Suspected compromise
    - Service recommends rotation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Profile">
```
    Create new profile: slack-main-v2
    Authenticate with new credentials
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Agent Configurations">
```
    Switch agents from slack-main to slack-main-v2
    Test all functionality
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete Old Profile">
```
    Once verified working:
    Delete slack-main profile
    Revoke old credentials at service
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication link doesn't work">
    Try:
    - Opening in a different browser
    - Clearing browser cache and cookies
    - Disabling browser extensions
    - Checking for popup blockers
    - Requesting a new authentication link
    - Ensure you're logged into the service
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Profile shows as disconnected">
    Verify:
    - Authentication was completed successfully
    - Required permissions were granted
    - Account credentials are still valid
    - Service hasn't revoked access
    - Try re-authenticating the profile
    - Check service-side connection settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent can't access profile tools">
    Check:
    - Profile is configured for the agent
    - Required tools are enabled
    - Profile is connected and authenticated
    - Agent has correct profile assigned
    - Permissions on service allow the action
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't delete profile">
    Ensure:
    - Profile is not in use by active agents
    - Remove profile from all agent configurations first
    - Wait a moment and try again
    - Check if you have deletion permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple profiles for same service causing confusion">
    Organize:
    - Use clear, descriptive naming
    - Document which profile is for what
    - Delete unused duplicate profiles
    - Standardize on one profile per use case
    - Consider environment-specific naming
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="OAuth token expired or invalid">
    Solutions:
    - Re-authenticate the profile
    - Create new profile if re-auth fails
    - Check service account status
    - Verify permissions weren't revoked
    - Some services require periodic re-authorization
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Credential Management

### Multi-Account Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Profiles for Each Account">
```
    For multiple Slack workspaces:
    - slack-company-a
    - slack-company-b
    - slack-company-c
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign to Dedicated Agents">
```
    Company A Agent → slack-company-a
    Company B Agent → slack-company-b
    Company C Agent → slack-company-c
    
    Prevents cross-posting to wrong workspace
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Template Variables">
```
    Create reusable workflows:
    "Post to {{company_workspace}} Slack"
    
    Each agent substitutes its company value
```
  </Step>
</Steps>
