description: "Learn how to activate and use the image vision tool to enable your Utari workers to analyze, describe, and interpret images within conversations."
---

## Overview

The image vision tool empowers your Utari workers to "see" and analyze images. This capability enables workers to describe visual content, extract information from images, answer questions about pictures, and provide detailed analysis of visual elements. It's essential for any workflow involving visual content, design review, image analysis, or visual data extraction.

## Image Vision Capabilities

When you enable the image vision tool, your worker gains two essential capabilities:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Load Images" icon="image">
    Upload and analyze images from files or URLs for visual analysis and interpretation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clear Images from Context" icon="eraser">
    Remove images from the conversation to manage the 3-image limit and free up space for new images
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Important Limitation**: Workers can only process up to **3 images** at a time in a single conversation. Use the "clear images from context" capability to remove images when you reach this limit.
</Warning>

## Enabling Image Vision

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Worker">
    Navigate to the worker you want to configure and click on the **Tools** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Image Vision Tool">
    Scroll through the available tools to locate **Image Vision**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Tool">
    Check the box next to Image Vision to activate both capabilities:

    - Load images
    - Clear images from context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Capabilities">
    Ensure both capabilities are enabled so your worker can both upload and manage images effectively.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Your changes are automatically saved. The worker can now analyze images.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Image Vision

### Uploading and Analyzing Images

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Chat">
    Open a conversation with a worker that has image vision enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload an Image">
    Click the **Attach files** button and select an image from your computer, or provide an image URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Analysis">
    Ask your worker to analyze the image. For example:

    ```
        Can you please explain this image to me?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Analysis">
    Your worker will:

    - Load and process the image
    - Analyze visual elements
    - Provide a detailed description
    - Answer specific questions about the content
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Analysis Output

When analyzing an image, your worker provides detailed descriptions such as:

```
This is a striking graphic design with bold red, orange, and black color scheme, split into two contrasting scenes:

Left side: Urban market scene with vibrant colors and busy atmosphere
Right side: A solitary figure against a darker background

The composition creates a dramatic contrast between communal energy and individual isolation.
```

## Image Management Features

### Viewing Image Controls

Once an image is uploaded, you have several controls:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Enlarge" icon="magnifying-glass-plus">
    Click to view the image at a larger size
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimize" icon="magnifying-glass-minus">
    Click to reduce the image size
  </Card>
  <Card title="Download" icon="download">
    Save the image to your device
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managing the 3-Image Limit

When you reach the 3-image limit:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognize the Limit">
    You'll be unable to upload additional images once 3 are loaded in the conversation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Images">
    Request your worker to clear images:

    ```
        Can you please clear the images from the context?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload New Images">
    Once cleared, you can upload up to 3 new images to continue your work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Clear images strategically. If you need to reference previous images later, save your analysis or download the images before clearing them.
</Tip>
