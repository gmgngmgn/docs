## Overview

The task management tool enables your workers to break down complex requests into organized, trackable tasks. This tool is essential for multi-step workflows where your worker needs to maintain awareness of progress, sequence actions, and coordinate between different phases of work.

## How Task Management Works

The task management tool allows your worker to:

1. **Create structured task lists** for complex workflows
2. **Track progress** through multi-step processes
3. **Maintain context** about what's been completed and what's remaining
4. **Coordinate sequential actions** in the correct order
5. **Visualize workflow progress** in real-time

<Info>
  Think of the task management tool as giving your worker the ability to create and follow a checklist, ensuring nothing gets missed in complex workflows.
</Info>

## Enabling the Task Management Tool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Worker">
    Navigate to the worker you want to configure and click on the **Tools** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Task Management">
    Scroll through the available tools to locate **Task Management**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Tool">
    Check the box next to Task Management to activate it for this worker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Capabilities">
    The task management tool includes five core capabilities:

    - **View tasks**: See all current tasks
    - **Create tasks**: Add new tasks to the list
    - **Update tasks**: Modify existing tasks and mark progress
    - **Delete tasks**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks
    - **Clear all**: Reset the entire task list
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  All five capabilities are typically enabled by default. You can customize which capabilities to enable based on your workflow needs.
</Note>

## Using Task Management in Workflows

Once enabled, your worker can automatically create and manage tasks during conversations.

### Creating a Task List

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Chat">
    Open a conversation with your worker that has task management enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Task Creation">
    Ask your worker to create a task list for a complex process. For example:

    ```
        Please create a task list on how to create VSLs
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch Task Generation">
    Your worker will:

    - Understand your request
    - Break down the process into logical steps
    - Create tasks in the task panel on the right side
    - Display the structured task list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Task Structure">
    Tasks appear in the right sidebar, organized by category and sequence. For example, a VSL creation workflow might include:

    - Research and Planning
    - Script Development
    - Visual Planning
    - Production
    - Post-Production
    - Landing Page Setup
  </Step>
</Steps>
