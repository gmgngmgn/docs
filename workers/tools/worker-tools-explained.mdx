## Understanding Tools

Tools are capabilities that extend what your workers can do. Each tool serves a specific purpose and adds functionality to your agent's workflow.

<Warning>
  **Important**: Don't enable all tools by default. Too many tools can impact performance by consuming context space and potentially reducing output quality. Only activate tools that are directly relevant to your worker's primary tasks.
</Warning>

## Accessing Tool Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Worker">
    Navigate to [Workers](https://utari.ai/dashboard) and select the worker you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Tools Tab">
    Click on the **Tools** tab in the worker's configuration panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Available Tools">
    Browse through the list of available tools. Each tool includes a description of its capabilities and use cases.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Activating Tools

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Required Tools">
    Before activating tools, determine your worker's primary purpose:
    - **Content Creation**: Document creator, presentation creator, spreadsheet tools
    - **Research**: Web search, web fetch, knowledge base
    - **Visual Content**: Image generation, image editing, visual tools
    - **Analysis**: Data processing, spreadsheet analysis
    - **Communication**: Email tools, messaging integrations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Selected Tools">
    Click the checkbox next to each tool you want to activate for this worker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Your selections are automatically saved. The worker can now use these tools during execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing Tool Options

Many tools have multiple capabilities that can be individually enabled or disabled.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Tool Settings">
    Click on **Enable tools** or the settings icon next to a specific tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Available Options">
    You'll see a list of specific capabilities for that tool. For example, a document tool might have 6 different options for various document operations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Specific Capabilities">
    Deselect any capabilities you don't want this worker to use. This helps maintain focus and reduce context usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click outside the settings panel or on a save button to apply your customization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Limiting tools to only the capabilities you need helps your worker perform more efficiently and stay focused on its primary tasks.
