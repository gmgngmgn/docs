## Two Presentation Workflows

### Custom Theme (Default)

The default approach for creating truly unique, brand-aligned presentations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Phase">
    - Research the topic and target audience
    - Identify brand colors and visual identity
    - Gather relevant visual references
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Design Phase">
    - Define custom color scheme
    - Establish design elements and patterns
    - Create visual hierarchy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Content Phase">
    - Create content outline
    - Search for relevant images
    - Download all required images
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Phase">
    - Use `create_slide` for each slide
    - Apply custom styling consistently
    - Validate each slide
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **When to Use Custom Theme**: This is the default workflow. Use it for:
  - Original, unique presentations
  - Brand-specific designs
  - Custom color schemes
  - When user doesn't explicitly request a template
  - When creating distinctive visual identities
</Info>

### Template-Based (On Request)

Use pre-designed templates for faster creation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Template Selection">
    - User explicitly requests a template
    - Call `list_templates` to show options
    - User selects their preferred template
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Load Template">
    - Use `load_template_design` with presentation name
    - Template is copied to workspace
    - All design elements preserved
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Content Update">
    - Use `full_file_rewrite` to update text content
    - Preserve 100% of CSS styling
    - Keep HTML structure identical
    - Only modify text and data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export">
    - Export to PPTX and PDF
    - Download or store locally
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **CRITICAL**: Only use templates when the user **explicitly requests** them with phrases like:
  - "Use a template"
  - "Show me templates"
  - "Use the minimalist template"
  - "I want to use a template"
  
  Do NOT use templates by default or when the user wants a unique/custom design.
</Warning>

## Creating Slides

### Create Slide Tool

Create or update individual slides in custom theme presentations.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Dimensions: 1920×1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: Standalone HTML file
- Auto-validation: Width ≤1920px, Height ≤1080px
- Box-sizing: Use `border-box` on padded containers

<Warning>
  **When to Use create_slide**:
  - ONLY for custom theme presentations
  - After completing Phase 3 (research, outline, images downloaded)
  
  **When NOT to use create_slide**:
  - Template-based presentations (use `full_file_rewrite` instead)
  - Before images are downloaded
  - Before design phase is complete
</Warning>

### Slide Creation Example
```text
User: Create a presentation about sustainable energy

Worker Process:
1. Phase 1 - Research:
   - Research sustainable energy topics
   - Identify target audience
   - Analyze visual trends in energy sector

2. Phase 2 - Design:
   - Custom color scheme: Green (#2D5016), Blue (#0066CC), White (#FFFFFF)
   - Design elements: Clean, modern, data-focused
   - Typography: Sans-serif, professional

3. Phase 3 - Content:
   - Content outline for 10 slides
   - Image search for relevant visuals
   - Download all images to workspace

4. Phase 4 - Build:
   - Create title slide with create_slide
   - Create content slides with create_slide
   - Validate each slide with validate_slide
   - Export presentation
```

## Working with Templates

### Listing Templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Requests Template">
```
    User: "Show me available presentation templates"
    User: "I want to use a template for my presentation"
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Call list_templates">
    Worker calls `list_templates` to display available options.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Present Options">
    Show user the available templates with descriptions:
    - Minimalist
    - Corporate
    - Creative
    - Educational
    - Tech-focused
    - (etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User Selects">
```
    User: "Use the Minimalist template"
    User: "I'll go with the Corporate one"
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Loading and Using Templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load Template Design">
```
    load_template_design(
      template_name="minimalist",
      presentation_name="Q4_Sales_Report"
    )
```
    
    This copies the entire template to `/workspace/presentations/Q4_Sales_Report/`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Template Structure">
    Examine the template's:
    - Color scheme
    - Typography
    - Layout patterns
    - Slide structure
    - CSS styling
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Content Only">
    Use `full_file_rewrite` to modify ONLY the text content:
    - Replace placeholder text
    - Update data and statistics
    - Change headings and bullet points
    - Swap images if needed
    
    **CRITICAL**: Preserve 100% of:
    - CSS styling
    - Colors and fonts
    - HTML structure
    - Layout positioning
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate and Export">
    Validate slides and export when complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Template Editing Rules**:
  - ✅ Change text content
  - ✅ Update data and numbers
  - ✅ Replace images
  - ✅ Modify headings
  - ❌ Change colors
  - ❌ Alter fonts
  - ❌ Modify CSS styling
  - ❌ Change HTML structure
  - ❌ Adjust layouts
</Warning>

## Slide Validation

### Validate Slide Tool

Ensures slides fit within standard presentation dimensions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Slide">
    Build your slide with content and styling.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Call validate_slide">
```
    validate_slide(
      presentation_name="My_Presentation",
      slide_number=1
    )
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Validation">
    Check if content height exceeds 1080px:
    - ✅ Valid: Content fits within dimensions
    - ❌ Invalid: Content overflow detected
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fix if Needed">
    If validation fails:
    - Reduce content amount
    - Decrease font sizes
    - Adjust padding/margins
    - Use `box-sizing: border-box`
    - Compress images
    - Reflow layout
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Re-validate">
    Validate again after fixes until passing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Validate slides immediately after creation to catch dimension issues early. It's easier to fix one slide than to discover overflow issues across an entire presentation later.
</Tip>

## Managing Presentations

```text
User: Show me all my presentations

Worker: [Calls list_presentations]

Available presentations:
- Q4_Sales_Report (8 slides)
