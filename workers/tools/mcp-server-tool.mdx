## Overview

MCP Server Search enables your Utari workers to discover, explore, and integrate external tools and services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This powerful capability allows agents to connect with specialized APIs, services, and integrations beyond Utari's built-in tools—creating unlimited possibilities for customization and extension.

## What is MCP?

<Card title="Model Context Protocol" icon="puzzle-piece">
  MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized way for AI agents to connect with external tools, services, and APIs. Think of it as a universal connector that allows your agents to:

  - Access specialized third-party services
  - Integrate with niche APIs and platforms
  - Use custom tools built by the community
  - Extend capabilities beyond built-in features
  - Connect with proprietary internal systems
</Card>

<Info>
  MCP servers are external integrations managed through Composio, providing structured access to hundreds of applications and services.
