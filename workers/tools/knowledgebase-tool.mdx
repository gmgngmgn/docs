description: "Store and retrieve information from your personal knowledge library using semantic search, file organization, and intelligent information retrieval capabilities."

## Overview

The Knowledge Base tool enables your Utari workers to store, organize, and intelligently retrieve information from a personal knowledge library. Using semantic search and natural language queries, agents can find relevant information across documents, maintain organized file structures, and access contextual knowledge to inform their responses and actions.

<Info>
  The Knowledge Base uses semantic search, meaning it understands the meaning and context of queries rather than just matching keywords. Ask questions naturally, and the system finds relevant information even if exact words don't match.
</Info>

## Understanding the Knowledge Base

### What is Semantic Search?

<Card title="Semantic Search Explained" icon="brain">
  Unlike traditional keyword search, semantic search understands:

  - **Meaning and Context**: "How do I improve sales?" finds information about "increasing revenue" and "customer conversion"
  - **Related Concepts**: Searching for "pricing strategy" finds documents about "monetization" and "value-based pricing"
  - **Natural Language**: Ask questions as you would ask a person
  - **Intent Recognition**: Understands what you're really looking for

  **Example**:

  - Query: "How should we position our product?"
  - Finds: Documents about "market positioning," "competitive advantage," "value proposition," and "target audience definition"
</Card>

### Global vs. Local Knowledge Base

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Global Knowledge Base">
    **Location**: Cloud-based, accessible across all agents

    **Purpose**:

    - Centralized knowledge repository
    - Shared across workspace
    - Persistent storage
    - Version controlled

    **Management**:

    - Upload files from sandbox
    - Create folder structure
    - Enable/disable for specific agents
    - Delete when no longer needed

    **Use Cases**:

    - Company SOPs and guidelines
    - Reusable templates
    - Shared reference materials
    - Brand guidelines
    - Product documentation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Sandbox Copy">
    **Location**: ~/knowledge-base-global in workspace

    **Purpose**:

    - Fast local access
    - Working copy for agent
    - Synced from global KB
    - Temporary processing

    **Creation**:

    - Sync from global KB
    - Downloads enabled files
    - Maintains folder structure
    - Updates when synced

    **Use Cases**:

    - Real-time access during tasks
    - Processing and analysis
    - Quick reference
    - Local file operations

    ```
        Search the knowledge base for information about our pricing strategy
        
        Find documents related to customer onboarding best practices
        
        What does our knowledge base say about competitive positioning?
        
        Look for information about Q4 marketing campaigns
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Worker Performs Semantic Search">
    The system:

    - Understands the semantic meaning of your query
    - Searches all indexed files in knowledge base
    - Ranks results by relevance
    - Returns most pertinent information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    ```
        Found 3 relevant documents:
        
        1. "Pricing Strategy 2024.pdf" (95% relevance)
           "Our tiered pricing model focuses on value-based pricing 
           aligned with customer segments..."

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File shows as indexing for long time">
    Possible causes:

    - Large file size (may take longer)
    - Complex document structure
    - High system load
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for large files
    - Check file isn't corrupted
    - Try re-uploading if stuck
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't upload file to knowledge base">
    Ensure:

    - File exists in workspace sandbox first
    - File path is correct
    - File format is supported
    - Sufficient storage space
    - File isn't corrupted
    - Try smaller file or different format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Search results not relevant">
    Improve by:

    - Using more specific, natural language queries
    - Providing context in your search
    - Checking if right files are enabled
    - Ensuring files contain expected information
    - Trying question-based queries
    - Updating knowledge base with better documents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sync fails or incomplete">
    Try:

    - Check network connection
    - Verify permissions on files
    - Run sync again
    - Check available disk space
    - List contents to see what should sync
    - Contact support if persists
