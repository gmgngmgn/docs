## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search not returning relevant results">
    Try:

    - Making your query more specific

    - Using different keywords or phrases
    - Specifying time frames (recent, 2024, latest)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Worker not using web search automatically">
    Ensure:

    - Web search tool is enabled in worker configuration
