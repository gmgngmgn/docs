## Overview

Triggers & Automation enables your Utari workers to execute automatically based on schedules or real-world events. This powerful capability transforms agents from on-demand assistants into autonomous workers that monitor, respond, and act without manual intervention—creating sophisticated automation workflows that run 24/7.

## Trigger Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Scheduled Triggers" icon="clock">
    Run agents automatically at specified times using flexible cron expressions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event Triggers" icon="bolt">
    Execute agents in response to real-world events from connected applications
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Triggers can be combined with template variables to create reusable automation workflows that adapt to different contexts and use cases.

## Trigger Capabilities

### Scheduled Trigger Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Scheduled Trigger" icon="plus">
    Set up automatic execution at specific times using cron expressions.

    **Features**:

    - Flexible scheduling with cron syntax
    - Template variables for reusable prompts
    - Custom execution instructions
    - Multiple triggers per agent

    **Example**:

    ```
        Create a scheduled trigger to run daily at 9 AM:
        - Monitor {{company_name}} brand mentions
        - Analyze sentiment
        - Generate daily report
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Get Scheduled Triggers" icon="list">
    View all scheduled triggers for the current agent.

    **Information Shown**:

    - Trigger schedule (cron expression)
    - Execution instructions
    - Enabled/disabled status
    - Last run time
    - Next scheduled run

    **Example**:

    ```
        Show me all scheduled triggers for this agent
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Toggle Scheduled Trigger" icon="toggle-on">
    Enable or disable triggers without deleting them.

    **Use Cases**:

    - Temporarily pause automation
    - Seasonal adjustments
    - Testing and maintenance
    - Resource management

    **Example**:

    ```
        Disable the weekend reporting trigger
        Pause all triggers during holiday period
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delete Scheduled Trigger" icon="trash">

    ```
        Delete the outdated quarterly report trigger
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Event Trigger Management

    Discover which applications support event-based triggers.

    **Information Provided**:

    - App name and slug
    - App logo
    - Available integrations
    - Event capabilities

    **Example**:

    ```

        What applications can trigger automation?
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="List App Event Triggers" icon="list-check">
    View available triggers for a specific application.

    **Information Provided**:

    **Process**:

    1. Choose application
    2. Select event type
    3. Configure trigger settings
    4. Define agent response
    5. Use template variables for reusability

    **Example**:

    ```
        Create a trigger that:
        - Monitors new emails in Gmail
        - From {{client_name}}
        - Automatically drafts response
        - Saves to drafts for review
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Template Variables

Template variables make triggers reusable across different contexts:

### Using Template Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Variables in Prompts">
    Use `{{variable_name}}` syntax in trigger instructions:

    ```
        Monitor {{company_name}} brand mentions on social media
        Track {{competitor_name}} product launches
        Alert on {{keyword}} discussions in {{industry}}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Users Provide Values">
    When installing or using the trigger, users provide their specific values:

    ```
        company_name: "Acme Corp"
        competitor_name: "TechRival Inc"
        keyword: "artificial intelligence"
        industry: "healthcare"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dynamic Execution">
    The trigger executes with user-specific context:

    ```
        Result: Monitor Acme Corp brand mentions on social media
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Template Variables

<CodeGroup>

```text Company/Brand
{{company_name}} - Your company name
{{brand_name}} - Brand being monitored
{{competitor_name}} - Competitor to track
{{product_name}} - Product being analyzed
```


```text Contact Information
{{client_name}} - Client or customer name
{{contact_email}} - Email address
{{team_member}} - Team member name
{{department}} - Department or division
```


```text Content & Keywords
{{keyword}} - Monitoring keyword
{{topic}} - Subject area
{{hashtag}} - Social media hashtag
{{category}} - Content category
```


```text Location & Time
{{location}} - Geographic area
{{region}} - Business region
{{timezone}} - Time zone
{{market}} - Target market
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Use descriptive variable names that make it obvious what value should be provided. `{{primary_competitor}}` is clearer than `{{comp1}}`.
</Tip>
