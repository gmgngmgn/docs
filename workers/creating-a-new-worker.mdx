## Creating Your Worker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Workers">
    Log into your Utari account at https://utari.ai/dashboard and click on **Workers** in the main navigation. Think of workers as employees that specialize in specific tasks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Creation Process">
    Click **Add Workers** on the left-hand side. You'll have the option to:

    - Create from scratch
    - Explore templates

    For this guide, select **Create from scratch**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Worker">
    Click on "New Worker" and give your worker a descriptive name (e.g., "VSL Worker").

    You can also:

    - Change the worker's icon
    - Customize the color scheme
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Initial Configuration">
    Click **Save changes** to create your worker.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Instructions

Instructions are the core prompt that guides your worker's behavior.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Instructions">
    Click on the **Instructions** tab in your worker's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Default Prompt">
    Utari provides a robust default prompt that works well for most use cases. We recommend leaving it as-is and using the **Knowledge** feature to guide specific behaviors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize (Optional)">
    If you need to modify the instructions:

    - Click on the instructions text
    - Read through the entire prompt carefully
    - Make targeted changes to specific sections
    - Click **Save** when done
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The default instructions are comprehensive and tested. Only modify them if you have a specific need and understand the full context of the prompt.
</Warning>

## Adding Tools

Tools give your worker specific capabilities to perform actions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Tools">
    Click on the **Tools** tab in your worker's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Available Tools">
    Browse through the available tools, which include:

    - Web search
    - Image creation/editing
    - Presentation creation
    - Document creation
    - File uploads
    - And many more
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Required Tools">
    Check the box next to each tool you want to enable for this worker. Only activated tools will be available during execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learn About Each Tool">
    Check our individual tool documentation to understand what each capability does and when to use it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Start with essential tools for your worker's primary task, then add more as needed. Too many tools can sometimes slow down decision-making.
</Tip>

## Connecting Integrations

Integrations allow your worker to access third-party applications.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">
    Click on the **Integrations** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse Available Apps">
    Click **Browse Apps** to see all available integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an Integration">
    For example, to add Google Drive:

    1. Find Google Drive in the list
    2. Click **Add**
    3. Click **Create new connection**
    4. Click **Create connection** then **Connect**
    5. Select your Google account in the popup
    6. Click **Continue** to grant permissions
    7. Click **I've completed authentication**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Integration Tools">
    After connecting:

    - Review the available tools for that integration
    - Enable the specific tools you want your worker to use
    - Click **Save tools**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings (Optional)">
    Click the settings gear icon to adjust access permissions for specific tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Knowledge

Knowledge provides your worker with additional context, SOPs, and frameworks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge">
    Click on the **Knowledge** tab in your worker's configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Existing Knowledge">
    Browse through available SOPs and documents in your knowledge base.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Relevant Knowledge">
    Select the specific documents or SOPs that are relevant to this worker's tasks. For example:

    - For a VSL worker, activate the "Mastering VSLs" SOP
    - For a content writer, activate your content style guides
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Workers can only access knowledge that has been explicitly activated for them. See our [Using Jeremy SOPs in Utari](/jeremy-sops) guide for more details on managing knowledge.
</Note>

## Setting Up Triggers

Triggers enable your worker to run automatically on a schedule or based on events.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Trigger">
    In the **Triggers** tab, click **Create new**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Trigger Type">
    Select:

    - **Schedule Trigger**: Run on a time-based schedule
    - **Event-based Trigger**: Run when specific events occur
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Schedule Trigger">
    For a scheduled trigger:

    1. Select your worker from the dropdown
    2. Give the trigger a descriptive name (e.g., "Daily VSL Creation")
    3. Click **Set schedule and timing**
    4. Choose frequency:
       - **Quick**: Pre-set intervals (daily, weekly, etc.)
       - **Recurring**: Custom recurring patterns
       - **One time**: Single execution
       - **Advanced**: Complex schedules
    5. Set the time and timezone
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Execution Method">
    Click **Next** to proceed to the execution configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Trigger Prompt">
    Enter the instructions for what the worker should do when triggered. For example:

    ```
        Every day, create a VSL based on the Mastering VSL doc on how to use AI for business.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and Manage">
    - Click **Create schedule tasks** to activate
    - Use the pause button to temporarily disable
    - Click the settings icon to edit the trigger
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Worker

Once configured, you can interact with your worker through chat.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Chat">
    Click **Start Chat** to open a conversation with your worker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Worker">
    Ensure your newly created worker is selected from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Model (Optional)">
    Select your preferred AI model from the model dropdown if you want to use something other than the default.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach Files (Optional)">
    Click **Attach files** to upload any documents or images needed for the task.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Prompt">
    Type your request in the chat. For example:

    ```
        Please create a VSL on how AI can be used for business using the Mastering VSL doc.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Worker Process">
    Watch as your worker:

    - Understands your request
    - Searches its knowledge base
    - Uses activated tools
    - Generates the response
  </Step>
</Steps>
