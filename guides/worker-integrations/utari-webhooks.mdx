description: "Connect third-party apps to Utari workers using webhooks for automated, event-driven workflows that respond to external triggers in real-time."
---

## Overview

Webhook Integrations enable your Utari workers to respond automatically to events from external applications. When something happens in a third-party app—like a meeting ending, a form submission, or a payment completing—that app can trigger your Utari worker to process the information and take action, creating powerful automated workflows.

## How Webhook Integrations Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Occurs in External App">
    Something happens in the third-party application:
    - Meeting recording completes (Fathom, Zoom)
    - Form submitted (Typeform, Google Forms)
    - Payment received (Stripe, PayPal)
    - Email received (Gmail, SendGrid)
    - Calendar event created (Google Calendar)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="App Sends Webhook">
    The external app sends data to your Utari webhook URL with information about what happened.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Utari Worker Activated">
    Your configured worker receives the webhook data and executes your custom prompt.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Worker Takes Action">
    The worker processes the information and performs configured tasks:
    - Extract and analyze data
    - Update other systems
    - Send notifications
    - Create documents
    - Trigger workflows
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Webhooks enable real-time automation—workers respond immediately when events occur, without manual intervention or scheduled checking.
</Info>

## Setting Up Webhook Integrations

### Part 1: Configure Utari Worker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose or Create Worker">
    Select a worker for handling webhook events:
    
    **Option A: Use Existing Worker**
    - Good for general-purpose automation
    - Can handle multiple webhook types
    
    **Option B: Create Dedicated Worker** (Recommended)
    - Specialized for specific webhook events
    - Tailored instructions for consistent handling
    - Easier to track and manage
```
    Example: "Meeting Transcription Processor"
    Purpose: Handle meeting recording webhooks from Fathom
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Required Integration (If Needed)">
    If the webhook source requires API access:
```
    1. Go to worker → Integrations → Browse Apps
    2. Search for the service (e.g., "Fathom")
    3. Click "Add" → "Create new connection"
    4. Get API key from service:
       - Log into third-party service
       - Find API/Developer settings
       - Generate new API key
       - Copy key
    5. Paste API key into Utari
    6. Click "Connect"
    7. Enable relevant tools
```
    
    <Info>
      Not all webhooks require integration. Some only send data without needing API access back to the service.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Webhook Trigger">
    Set up the webhook endpoint:
    
    **Method 1: From Worker**
```
    1. Go to worker → Triggers tab
    2. Click "Create new trigger"
    3. Select "Webhook trigger"
```
    
    **Method 2: From Triggers Dashboard**
```
    1. Go to Triggers → Add Trigger
    2. Select "Webhook trigger"
    3. Choose the worker
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Webhook Details">
    **Trigger Name**:
    
    Give your webhook a descriptive name
    
    Examples: "Fathom Meeting Processor" or "Typeform Submission Handler"
    
    **Description (Optional)**:
    
    Brief description of what this webhook handles
    
    **Security**:
    
    Toggle "Require Secret Token" (Recommended)
    - Enables security verification
    - Ensures data comes from legitimate source
    - Prevents unauthorized webhook calls
    
    Webhook calls must include a secret token for authentication
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Prompt Template">
    **Agent Instructions**:
    
    Define what your agent should do when a webhook is received
    
    **Basic Structure**:
```
    Process the following [event type].
    
    Extract:
    - [Key information 1]
    - [Key information 2]
    - [Key information 3]
    
    Then:
    1. [Action step 1]
    2. [Action step 2]
    3. [Action step 3]
    
    Do not ask for confirmation—execute automatically.
```
    
    **Available Variables**:
    
    Use these placeholders in your template - they'll be replaced with actual webhook data:
    
    - `{{payload}}` - Full webhook payload as JSON
    - `{{payload.field}}` - Specific field from payload (e.g., payload.title)
    - `{{payload.nested.field}}` - Nested field access
    - `{{timestamp}}` - When the webhook was received
    - `{{trigger_name}}` - Name of this trigger
    
    **Example Template**:
```
    Process the following meeting recording:
    
    Title: {{payload.meeting_title}}
    Recording URL: {{payload.recording_url}}
    
    Please summarize the key points and action items.
```
    
    **Model Selection**:
    
    Choose which model to use for processing webhooks
    
    - **Utari Basic** (Recommended for most webhook processing tasks)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Trigger">
    Click "Create Trigger"
    
    You'll receive:
    - **Webhook URL**: Starts with `https://utari.up.railway.app/v1/triggers/...`
    - **Secret Token**: One-time display (if enabled)
    
    **IMPORTANT: Copy both immediately!**
    
    Example webhook URL:
```
    https://utari.up.railway.app/v1/triggers/373a2...
```
    
    The secret token should be included in the `x-webhook-secret` header
    
    <Warning>
      **Save the secret token now!** It won't be shown again. You'll need to include it in the `x-webhook-secret` header when the third-party service calls your webhook.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook URL and Secret Token

After creating your webhook trigger, you'll receive:

**Webhook URL**:

Configure your external service to send POST requests to this URL:
```
https://utari.up.railway.app/v1/triggers/[your-trigger-id]
```

Copy this URL and paste it into the webhook configuration of your third-party service (Fathom, Typeform, Stripe, etc.)

**Secret Token**:

If you enabled "Require Secret Token", include this in the `x-webhook-secret` header:

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://utari.up.railway.app/v1/triggers/373a2...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-webhook-secret: sk_trigger_So1ECq1Dat9hxcPip0OMPq912fvL9rPwKbu8bph3sW8' \
  -d '{"event": "example", "data": "your payload"}'
```

### Part 2: Configure Third-Party App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Webhook Settings">
    In the third-party application:
```
    Common locations:
    - Settings → Webhooks
    - Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
    - Settings → API → Webhooks
    - Developer → Webhooks
    - Automation → Webhooks
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Webhook">
```
    1. Click "Add Webhook" or "Create Webhook"
    2. Paste Utari webhook URL as destination
    3. Select event types to trigger webhook
    4. Configure additional settings (if available)
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Trigger Events">
    Choose which events should activate the webhook:
```
    Examples:
    - Meeting completed
    - Form submitted
    - Payment received
    - File uploaded
    - Record created/updated
    
    Select only events you want to process
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Secret Token (If Required)">
```
    Some services request authentication:
    - Look for "Secret" or "Authentication" field
    - Paste the secret token from Utari
    - May be labeled as "Signing Secret" or "Verification Token"
    - Should be sent in x-webhook-secret header
    
    Not all services support custom headers
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Data Scope">
    Select what data to send:
```
    Common options:
    - Full payload (all data)
    - Transcript only
    - Metadata only
    - Custom fields
    
    Choose based on your processing needs
```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and Activate">
```
    Save the webhook configuration
    
    Webhook is now active!
    Events will trigger your Utari worker automatically
```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not triggering">
    Check:
    - Webhook URL copied correctly to third-party app
    - URL starts with `https://utari.up.railway.app/v1/triggers/`
    - Third-party app webhook is enabled/active
    - Event type selected in third-party app
    - Test webhook manually in third-party settings
    - Check third-party app webhook logs for errors
    - Verify worker is active in Utari
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Worker asking for input instead of executing">
    Fix prompt to be more directive:
    
    ❌ Current: "What should I do with this data?"
    
    ✅ Updated: "Process automatically without confirmation. Execute these steps immediately: [specific steps]"
    
    Add explicit instruction to not ask questions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't access specific data fields">
    Debug payload structure:
    
    1. Check a recent webhook run in trigger history
    2. View the raw payload received
    3. Identify correct field names
    4. Update prompt with correct variable syntax
    
    Examples:
    - `{{payload.field}}` for top-level fields
    - `{{payload.nested.field}}` for nested fields
    
    Note: If payload shows `transcriptId` but you used `transcript_id`, match the exact field name
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Integration tools not available">
    Verify:
    - Integration is connected in worker
    - API key is valid and active
    - Required tools are enabled
    - Worker has permission to use integration
    - Integration connection wasn't disconnected
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Webhook timing issues">
    Consider:
    - Some webhooks fire before data fully processed
    - Add wait time: "Wait 30 seconds after receiving webhook"
    - Implement retry logic for data retrieval
    - Check if third-party offers "processing complete" event
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Secret token authentication failing">
    Verify:
    - Secret token is included in `x-webhook-secret` header
    - Token was copied correctly (no extra spaces)
    - Third-party service supports custom headers
    - Token hasn't expired or been regenerated
    
    If you lost the token, you'll need to create a new webhook trigger
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many webhook triggers">
    Optimize:
    - Filter events more specifically in third-party app
    - Add conditional logic to prompt: "Only process if status equals completed"
    - Consider batching: Process every N minutes instead of real-time
    - Disable webhook temporarily if testing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
